    "How much can I borrow against my land?",
    "Loans range from $5,000 to $500,000, capped at 50% of your property's independently appraised value. A $200,000 property supports a maximum loan of $100,000. Terms run 6 to 60 months at rates between 8% and 18%.",
  ],
  [
    "Do I need good credit or income verification?",
    "No. SecuredLanding underwrites the land, not your paycheck. We verify ownership, run a title search, review tax status, and order an independent valuation. Your equity is your qualification.",
  ],
  [
    "What types of land qualify?",
    "Farmland, ranches, timberland, recreational and hunting properties, vacant acreage, and development parcels across all U.S. states where legally permitted.",
  ],
  [
    "How are investors protected?",
    "Every loan is secured by a recorded mortgage or deed of trust — first-position wherever possible. The 50% LTV ceiling means collateral is appraised at no less than twice the loan balance at origination, and a defined foreclosure-recovery process returns sale proceeds to investors first.",
  ],
  [
    "What returns can investors expect?",
    "Loans carry rates of 8–18%, with investors targeting 8–15% net annual returns after platform fees (a 1% annual servicing fee and 0.25%–1.00% management fee). Distributions of principal and interest are paid monthly.",
  ],
  [
    "Who can invest on the platform?",
    "Accredited investors, family offices, private funds, and self-directed IRA holders. All investors complete KYC/AML verification, and the platform operates within SEC and state lending frameworks.",
  ],
  [
    "What fees do borrowers pay?",
    "An origination fee of 2%–5% of the loan amount, typically deducted from proceeds at closing. For example, a $100,000 loan with a 3% fee nets $97,000 at funding. There are no application fees to pre-qualify.",
  ],
  [
    "How fast is the process?",
    "Our target approval window is 48–72 hours from a completed application — title work, valuation, and risk scoring are largely automated. Funding follows as soon as investors fill the loan, often within days.",
